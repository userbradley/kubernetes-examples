## What this is

This site is to hold documentation I make as I go along for Kubernetes manifests that I write, as well as possible values

Despite taking pride in my documentation, I trust the maintainers of the Kubernetes project more to write the descriptions.

Descriptions are copied from the below sites:

1. [https://kubernetes.io/docs/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
