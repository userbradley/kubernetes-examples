# Kubernetes Manifests documentation

## What is this

This is a public site I run to document the Kubernetes manifest files as well as all the possible values for them.

## Why this exists

I had trouble when learning Kubernetes with all the possibilities for the files, so I made this site (Will always be in Development)
for my self and peers so we have a quick reference sheet

## Where can I access it

[kubernetes.breadnet.co.uk](https://kubernetes.breadnet.co.uk) 

> :warning: The site is not active yet!

# Developing the site

## Adding pages

I encourage people to add pages. Please copy and paste from the `docs/template.md` and then find and replace parts etc etc.

Once done, open a PR and I will review etc etc.
